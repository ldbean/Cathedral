# Cathedral
A two-player, city-building strategy game.

Each player begins with the same set of buildings of varying shapes and takes turns placing their buildings within a 10 x 10 grid. The game ends when the grid no longer has space for the remaining pieces. The winner is determined by who's pieces' total area combined is the lesser of the two.
